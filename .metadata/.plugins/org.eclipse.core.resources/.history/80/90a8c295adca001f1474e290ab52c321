Exception:
----------
- Exception in Java refers to an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program's execution. 
- Exceptions are used to handle errors or unexpected behavior gracefully, allowing the program to continue 
  running or terminate gracefully instead of crashing.
  
Key Concepts in Java Exceptions:
--------------------------------
Exception Hierarchy:
- All exceptions in Java are part of the Throwable class hierarchy.

Throwable has two main subclasses:
----------------------------------
- Error: Indicates serious problems that applications should not handle (e.g., OutOfMemoryError, 
  StackOverflowError).
-Exception: Represents conditions that a program might want to handle.

Checked vs. Unchecked Exceptions:
---------------------------------
Checked Exceptions:
- Exceptions that must be declared in the method signature using throws or handled using a try-catch block.
- Examples: IOException, SQLException.

Unchecked Exceptions:
- Exceptions that do not need to be declared or handled explicitly.
- Examples: ArithmeticException, NullPointerException.

Common Exception Classes:
-------------------------
- ArithmeticException: For illegal arithmetic operations, like division by zero.
- NullPointerException: When an application tries to use a null object reference.
- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: When accessing invalid array indices.
- IOException: For input/output failures.
