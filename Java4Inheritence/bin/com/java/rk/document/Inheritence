Inheritence:
-----------
- Inheritance in Java is a mechanism where one class (called the child or subclass) acquires 
  the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) of another class (called the parent or superclass). 
- It promotes code reuse, modularity, and a hierarchical class structure.

Key Notes:
---------
Constructors in Inheritance:
- Constructors of the parent class are not inherited but can be called using super().

Final Classes and Methods:
- A final class cannot be extended.
- A final method cannot be overridden.

Multiple Inheritance with Interfaces:
-Java allows multiple inheritance using interfaces, not classes.

Object Class:
- Every class in Java implicitly inherits from the Object class, the root of the class hierarchy.

Advantages of Inheritance:
- Code reuse.
- Improves readability and maintainability.
- Enables method overriding for runtime polymorphism.

Disadvantages of Inheritance:
- Tight coupling between parent and child classes.
- Can lead to complex hierarchies if overused.
