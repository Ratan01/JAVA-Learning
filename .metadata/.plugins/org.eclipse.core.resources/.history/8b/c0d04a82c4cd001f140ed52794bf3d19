LinkedList (can also act as a queue):
-------------------------------------
- In Java, a LinkedList is a part of the java.util package and implements both the List and Deque interfaces. 
- This dual implementation allows it to act as both a queue and a stack, in addition to being a regular list. 
- Internally, it is a doubly-linked list, making it efficient for insertions and deletions.

Key Features of LinkedList as a Queue:
--------------------------------------
- FIFO (First-In-First-Out): When used as a queue, LinkedList follows the FIFO principle.
- Deque Support: It allows adding and removing elements from both ends when used as a deque.
- Dynamic Size: Automatically resizes without a fixed size constraint.
- Allows Null Values: Permits null elements.
- Performance: Efficient for frequent insertions and deletions, but slower for random access compared to ArrayList.
