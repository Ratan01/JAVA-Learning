- The StringBuilder class in Java is a mutable sequence of characters similar to StringBuffer, 
  but it is not thread-safe. 
- It was introduced in Java 5 as a faster alternative to StringBuffer for single-threaded environments.

Key Features of StringBuilder:
------------------------------
Mutability:
- StringBuilder objects can be modified without creating new ones.
- Operations like append, insert, replace, or delete modify the same object.

Performance:
- StringBuilder is faster than StringBuffer because it is not synchronized, making it ideal for single-threaded 
  applications.
  
Dynamic Size:
- The size of a StringBuilder grows dynamically as content is added.

Default Capacity:
- The default capacity is 16 characters. It increases automatically as needed.

Common Constructors:
--------------------
Default Constructor:
 StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); // Default capacity: 16
 
With Initial Capacity:
 StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(50); // Capacity: 50
 
With Initial String:
 StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
 
Commonly Used Methods:
----------------------
Append: Appends the specified string to the end of the sequence.
