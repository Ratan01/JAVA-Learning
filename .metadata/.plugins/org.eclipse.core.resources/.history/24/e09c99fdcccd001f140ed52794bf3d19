TreeMap (sorted, uses Red-Black Tree):
--------------------------------------
- A TreeMap in Java is part of the java.util package and implements the NavigableMap and SortedMap interfaces. 
- It stores key-value pairs in a sorted order of keys, based on the natural ordering of the keys or a custom 
  comparator provided at the time of creation. 
- Internally, it uses a Red-Black Tree, a self-balancing binary search tree, to ensure log(n) time complexity for 
  key-based operations.
  
Key Features of TreeMap:
------------------------
- Sorted Order: Maintains keys in ascending natural order or according to a custom comparator.
- No Null Keys: Does not allow null keys but allows multiple null values.
- Performance: Offers O(log n) time complexity for get(), put(), and remove() operations.
- Navigable Map Features: Provides methods to navigate keys and entries (e.g., ceilingKey, floorKey).
- Thread Safety: Not synchronized. Use Collections.synchronizedMap() for thread-safe operations.

Commonly Used Methods:
----------------------
Adding and Updating Entries:
- put(K key, V value): Adds a key-value pair or updates the value if the key already exists.

Accessing Entries:
- get(Object key): Retrieves the value associated with the specified key.
- firstKey(): Returns the first (lowest) key.
- lastKey(): Returns the last (highest) key.

Removing Entries:
- remove(Object key): Removes the mapping for the specified key.
- pollFirstEntry(): Removes and returns the first entry.
- pollLastEntry(): Removes and returns the last entry.

Navigating Keys:
- ceilingKey(K key): Returns the smallest key greater than or equal to the given key.
- floorKey(K key): Returns the largest key less than or equal to the given key.
- higherKey(K key): Returns the smallest key strictly greater than the given key.
- lowerKey(K key): Returns the largest key strictly less than the given key.

Other Methods:
- size(): Returns the number of key-value pairs.
- isEmpty(): Checks if the map is empty.
- keySet(): Returns a set of all keys.
- values(): Returns a collection of all values.
- entrySet(): Returns a set of key-value pairs as Map.Entry objects.
