Abstraction:
------------
- Abstraction is the process or mechanism of hiding the internal implementation details from the consumer 
  by exposing only necessary functionalities. 
- In java we can achieve abstraction either by using abstract class or by using Interface. 
- Abstraction is one of the important object oriented principle. 
- API is the best example for abstraction.

Benefits of Abstraction:
* Reduces Complexity: Focus on what the object does, not how it does it.
* Promotes Reusability: Abstract methods and interfaces provide reusable contracts.
* Enhances Maintainability: Implementation changes are isolated from the parts of the program that use the 
  abstraction.

Feature	                   Abstract Class	                         Interface
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Methods	      Can have both abstract and concrete methods	Only abstract methods (till Java 7). Can have default/static methods (Java 8+).
Constructors           Can have constructors                	Cannot have constructors
Multiple Inheritance	Cannot be extended by multiple classes	Can be implemented by multiple classes
Modifiers	 Abstract methods can have any access modifier	    Abstract methods are implicitly public
