LinkedHashSet (maintains insertion order):
------------------------------------------
- A LinkedHashSet in Java is a subclass of HashSet that maintains the insertion order of elements. 
- It is part of the java.util package and implements the Set interface. 
- Internally, it uses a combination of a HashMap and a LinkedList to achieve both uniqueness and order preservation.

Key Features of LinkedHashSet:
------------------------------
- Unique Elements: Like all sets, it does not allow duplicate elements.
- Preserves Insertion Order: Unlike HashSet, it maintains the order in which elements were inserted.
- Allows Null Value: Permits one null element.
- Performance: Slightly slower than HashSet due to the overhead of maintaining the insertion order, 
  but still offers O(1) time complexity for basic operations like add, remove, and contains.
- Not Synchronized: LinkedHashSet is not thread-safe, but it can be wrapped with Collections.
  synchronizedSet() for concurrent use.
