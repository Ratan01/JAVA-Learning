Hashtable (legacy, synchronized):
---------------------------------
- A Hashtable in Java is part of the java.util package and implements the Map interface. 
- It is one of the oldest implementations of a key-value pair storage in Java and provides synchronized operations, 
  making it thread-safe for concurrent access. 
- However, due to synchronization overhead, it is less efficient than alternatives like HashMap in single-threaded 
  environments.
  
Key Features of Hashtable:
--------------------------
- Thread-Safe: Synchronizes all methods, making it safe for concurrent use by multiple threads.
- No Null Keys or Values: Does not allow null keys or null values.
- Key-Value Pairs: Stores data in the form of key-value pairs, with each key being unique.
- No Guaranteed Order: Does not maintain any specific order for keys or entries.
- Performance: Slower compared to HashMap because of its synchronized methods.
