LinkedHashMap (maintains insertion order):
------------------------------------------
- A LinkedHashMap in Java is a part of the java.util package and extends the HashMap class. 
- It maintains a linked list of entries, ensuring that the elements are stored in the order in which they were inserted. 
- This makes it particularly useful when order matters, while still providing the fast access of a hash table.

Key Features of LinkedHashMap:
------------------------------
- Insertion Order Maintained: Preserves the order of keys as they are inserted.
- Custom Access Order: Can be configured to maintain access order instead of insertion order by using the 
  constructor with the accessOrder parameter.
- Allows Null: Permits one null key and multiple null values.
- erformance: Provides O(1) time complexity for get() and put() operations.
- Not Synchronized: It is not thread-safe, but you can synchronize it externally using Collections.synchronizedMap().
