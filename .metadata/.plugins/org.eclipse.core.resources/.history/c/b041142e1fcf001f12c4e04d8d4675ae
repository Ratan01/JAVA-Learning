- The StringBuilder class in Java is a mutable sequence of characters similar to StringBuffer, 
  but it is not thread-safe. 
- It was introduced in Java 5 as a faster alternative to StringBuffer for single-threaded environments.

Key Features of StringBuilder:
------------------------------
Mutability:
- StringBuilder objects can be modified without creating new ones.
- Operations like append, insert, replace, or delete modify the same object.

Performance:
- StringBuilder is faster than StringBuffer because it is not synchronized, making it ideal for single-threaded 
  applications.
  
Dynamic Size:
- The size of a StringBuilder grows dynamically as content is added.

Default Capacity:
- The default capacity is 16 characters. It increases automatically as needed.

Common Constructors:
--------------------
Default Constructor:
 StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); // Default capacity: 16
 
With Initial Capacity:
 StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(50); // Capacity: 50
 
With Initial String:
 StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
 
Commonly Used Methods:
----------------------
Append: Appends the specified string to the end of the sequence.
  StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
  sb.append(" World");
  System.out.println(sb); // Output: Hello World
  
Insert: Inserts a string at the specified position.
  sb.insert(5, " Java");
  System.out.println(sb); // Output: Hello Java World
  
Replace: Replaces characters in the specified range with a given string.
  sb.replace(6, 10, "Python");
  System.out.println(sb); // Output: Hello Python World
  
Delete: Removes characters in the specified range.
  sb.delete(6, 13);
  System.out.println(sb); // Output: Hello World
  
Reverse: Reverses the sequence of characters.
  sb.reverse();
  System.out.println(sb); // Output: dlroW olleH
  
Capacity: Returns the current capacity of the StringBuilder.
  System.out.println(sb.capacity()); // Default: 16 or more
  
Ensure Capacity: Ensures the capacity is at least equal to the specified minimum.
  sb.ensureCapacity(50);
  System.out.println(sb.capacity()); // Output: 50 or more
