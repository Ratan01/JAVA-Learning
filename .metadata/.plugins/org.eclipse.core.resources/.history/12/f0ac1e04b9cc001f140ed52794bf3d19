HashSet:
-------
- A HashSet in Java is a collection class provided by the java.util package that implements the Set interface. 
- It is backed by a HashMap, and it is designed to store unique elements, meaning duplicate values are not allowed. 
- The HashSet provides constant-time performance for basic operations like add, remove, and contains, assuming a good 
  hash function.
