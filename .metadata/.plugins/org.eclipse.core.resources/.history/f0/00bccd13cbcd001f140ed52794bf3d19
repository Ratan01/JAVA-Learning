HashMap (unordered, uses hashing):
----------------------------------
- A HashMap in Java is part of the java.util package and implements the Map interface. 
- It is used to store key-value pairs, where each key is unique, and values can be associated with these keys. 
- Internally, it uses a hash table for storing the data, ensuring efficient retrieval based on the hash code of the key.

Key Features of HashMap:
------------------------
- Key-Value Pairs: Stores data in the form of key-value pairs.
- Unique Keys: Each key must be unique, but values can be duplicated.
- Allows Null: Allows one null key and multiple null values.
- Not Ordered: Does not guarantee the order of keys or entries.
- Performance: Offers O(1) average time complexity for get() and put() operations.
- Not Synchronized: It is not thread-safe but can be made synchronized using Collections.synchronizedMap().
