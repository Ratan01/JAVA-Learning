Aggregation HAS-A:
------------------
- Aggregation in Java is a concept of object-oriented programming that represents a "HAS-A" relationship between objects. 
- It is a form of association where one object contains a reference to another object. 
- Aggregation allows one class to use the properties and methods of another class without inheriting it.

Key Characteristics of Aggregation:
-----------------------------------
- Weak Relationship: Aggregation represents a weak relationship between the two objects. If one object is deleted, 
  the other can still exist independently.
- HAS-A Relationship: It is used to represent a "HAS-A" relationship. For example, a Car has an Engine.
- Reusability: Aggregation promotes code reuse by enabling objects to be composed of other objects.

Advantages of Aggregation:
--------------------------
- Improved Code Organization: Helps in dividing complex systems into smaller, manageable classes.
- Code Reusability: Promotes reuse of classes in different contexts.
- Loosely Coupled Classes: Aggregation allows for loosely coupled relationships, making code easier to maintain.

Difference Between Aggregation and Composition:
-----------------------------------------------
- While aggregation represents a weak relationship, composition is a stronger form of association where the contained
  object cannot exist independently of the containing object. 
- For example, a "house" has "rooms" (composition). If the house is destroyed, the rooms are destroyed too.
