Abstraction:
------------
- Abstraction is the process or mechanism of hiding the internal implementation details from the consumer 
  by exposing only necessary functionalities. 
- In java we can achieve abstraction either by using abstract class or by using Interface. 
- Abstraction is one of the important object oriented principle. 
- API is the best example for abstraction.
