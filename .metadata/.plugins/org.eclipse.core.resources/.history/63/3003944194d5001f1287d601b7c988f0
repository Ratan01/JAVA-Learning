- Generics in Java is a powerful feature introduced in JDK 5 that allows developers to write reusable and type-safe code. 
- It enables classes, interfaces, and methods to operate on parameters of various types while providing compile-time type 
  checking.
  
Why Use Generics?
-----------------
- Type Safety: Generics enforce type checking at compile-time, reducing runtime errors.
- Code Reusability: They allow writing generic code that works with any data type.
- Avoid Casting: With generics, there's no need to cast objects when retrieving them from a collection.
