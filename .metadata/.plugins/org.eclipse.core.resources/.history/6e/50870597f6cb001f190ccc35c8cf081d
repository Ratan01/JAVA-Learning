Vector:
-------
- A Vector in Java is a dynamic array-like data structure provided by the java.util package. 
- It is similar to an ArrayList, but the main difference is that Vector is synchronized, making it thread-safe 
  for concurrent operations. 
- However, because of this synchronization, it is generally less efficient than ArrayList for single-threaded scenarios.

Key Features of Vector:
----------------------
- Resizable Array: Like ArrayList, Vector dynamically resizes itself when elements are added or removed.
- Thread-Safe: All methods in Vector are synchronized, making it safe for use in multi-threaded environments.
- Random Access: Elements can be accessed by index, just like in an array.
- Allows Duplicates and Nulls: Vector permits duplicate elements and allows null values.
- Legacy Class: Although still widely used, Vector is considered a legacy class and is often replaced by ArrayList 
  in modern code.
