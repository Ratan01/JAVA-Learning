Constructor:
------------
- A constructor in Java is a special method used to initialize objects of a class. 
- It has the same name as the class and does not have a return type, not even void. 
- The constructor is called automatically when an object of the class is created.

Rules:
-----
- The name of the constructor must match the class name.
- Constructors do not have a return type, not even void.
- A constructor is automatically called when an object of the class is created.
- Constructors can be overloaded by defining multiple constructors with different parameter lists.

Default Constructor:
--------------------
- A constructor with no arguments.
- If no constructor is explicitly defined, Java provides a default constructor.

Parameterized Constructor:
--------------------------
- A constructor that accepts parameters to initialize an object.
