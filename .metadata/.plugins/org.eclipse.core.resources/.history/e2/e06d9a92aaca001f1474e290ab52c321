Encapsulatio:
------------
- It is the process of binding or wrapping up of data members along with its’s data handler 
  methods i.e.., getters & setters.
- The main purpose of encapsulation is to control access to the internal state of an object and ensure 
  that the object is used in a controlled manner. 
- This is achieved by restricting direct access to some components of an object and allowing controlled 
  access through methods (getters and setters).

Benefits of Encapsulation:
• Protects the integrity of an object’s state by restricting direct access to its fields.
• Encourages modularity by bundling related variables and methods.
• Enhances security by controlling the access to an object's data.
• Facilitates debugging and testing, as logic related to data access can be centralized.

Java Bean specification:
• The bean class must be public non abstract class.
• Data members must be private.
• Each data member must have public getter and setter methods.
• Bean class must have public default constructors.
