Encapsulatio:
------------
- It is the process of binding or wrapping up of data members along with itsâ€™s data handler 
  methods i.e.., getters & setters.
- The main purpose of encapsulation is to control access to the internal state of an object and ensure 
  that the object is used in a controlled manner. 
- This is achieved by restricting direct access to some components of an object and allowing controlled 
  access through methods (getters and setters).
