--------
Purpose: A keyword used to declare constants, restrict inheritance, or prevent method overriding.

Usage:
------
With Variables:
- When a variable is declared final, its value cannot be changed once assigned.

  final int MAX_VALUE = 100;
  MAX_VALUE = 200; // Compilation Error
  
With Methods:
- A final method cannot be overridden in a subclass.

class Parent {
    final void display() {
        System.out.println("This is a final method.");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    void display() { // Compilation Error
        System.out.println("Cannot override final method.");
    }
}

With Classes:
- A final class cannot be extended.
