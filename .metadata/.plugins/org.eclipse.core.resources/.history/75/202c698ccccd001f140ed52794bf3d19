TreeMap (sorted, uses Red-Black Tree):
--------------------------------------
- A TreeMap in Java is part of the java.util package and implements the NavigableMap and SortedMap interfaces. 
- It stores key-value pairs in a sorted order of keys, based on the natural ordering of the keys or a custom 
  comparator provided at the time of creation. 
- Internally, it uses a Red-Black Tree, a self-balancing binary search tree, to ensure log(n) time complexity for 
  key-based operations.
