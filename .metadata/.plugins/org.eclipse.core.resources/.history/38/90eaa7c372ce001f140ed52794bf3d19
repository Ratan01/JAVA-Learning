String:
-------
- In Java, a String is a class in the java.lang package that represents a sequence of characters. 
- Strings are immutable in Java, meaning that once a String object is created, its value cannot be changed. 
- If you modify a String, a new String object is created.

Creating a String:
------------------
You can create a String in two main ways:

1. Using string literals:
   String str1 = "Hello, World!";
   String literals are stored in the String pool, a special memory area.
   
2. Using the new keyword:
   String str2 = new String("Hello, World!");
   This creates a new object in the heap, even if the same content exists in the String pool.
   
Common Methods in the String Class:
-----------------------------------
Here are some commonly used methods:

1. Length of a String:
   int length = str.length();
   
2. Concatenate Strings:
   String result = str1.concat(str2);  // Or use `+`: String result = str1 + str2;
   
3. Character at a Position:
   char ch = str.charAt(3);
