TreeMap (sorted, uses Red-Black Tree):
--------------------------------------
- A TreeMap in Java is part of the java.util package and implements the NavigableMap and SortedMap interfaces. 
- It stores key-value pairs in a sorted order of keys, based on the natural ordering of the keys or a custom 
  comparator provided at the time of creation. 
- Internally, it uses a Red-Black Tree, a self-balancing binary search tree, to ensure log(n) time complexity for 
  key-based operations.
  
Key Features of TreeMap:
------------------------
- Sorted Order: Maintains keys in ascending natural order or according to a custom comparator.
- No Null Keys: Does not allow null keys but allows multiple null values.
- Performance: Offers O(log n) time complexity for get(), put(), and remove() operations.
- Navigable Map Features: Provides methods to navigate keys and entries (e.g., ceilingKey, floorKey).
- Thread Safety: Not synchronized. Use Collections.synchronizedMap() for thread-safe operations.
