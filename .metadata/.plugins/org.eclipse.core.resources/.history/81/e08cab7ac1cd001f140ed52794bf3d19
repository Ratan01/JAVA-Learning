PriorityQueue (priority-based retrieval):
-----------------------------------------
- A PriorityQueue in Java is a part of the java.util package and implements the Queue interface. 
- It is a special type of queue where elements are ordered based on their natural ordering (if they implement 
  Comparable) or a custom Comparator. 
- Unlike a regular queue, the PriorityQueue does not guarantee FIFO (First-In-First-Out) order but ensures that 
  the element with the highest priority is at the head of the queue.
  
Key Features of PriorityQueue:
------------------------------
- Order of Elements: Maintains elements in a priority order, where the natural order or a custom comparator 
  determines the priority.
- Heap Implementation: Internally uses a binary heap for efficient priority handling.
- Duplicates Allowed: Allows duplicate elements.
- Null Not Allowed: Does not permit null elements.
- Performance: Offers O(log n) time complexity for insertion and removal operations.
- Not Synchronized: PriorityQueue is not thread-safe but can be synchronized externally if needed.
