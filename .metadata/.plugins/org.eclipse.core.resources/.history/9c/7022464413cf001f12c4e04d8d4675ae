- The StringBuffer class in Java is a mutable sequence of characters. 
- Unlike String, which is immutable, StringBuffer objects can be modified without creating new objects. 
- It is thread-safe because its methods are synchronized, meaning it can be used safely in a multithreaded environment.

Key Features of StringBuffer:
-----------------------------
Mutability:
- The content of a StringBuffer can be modified after its creation.
- Operations like append, insert, replace, or delete directly change the object's value.

Thread-Safety:
- Methods of StringBuffer are synchronized, making it suitable for multithreaded programs.
- However, synchronization can make it slower compared to StringBuilder, which is not thread-safe.

Dynamic Size:
- A StringBuffer object grows dynamically as more characters are added.

Default Capacity:
- The default capacity of a StringBuffer is 16 characters. If the content exceeds this capacity, it is 
  automatically increased.
