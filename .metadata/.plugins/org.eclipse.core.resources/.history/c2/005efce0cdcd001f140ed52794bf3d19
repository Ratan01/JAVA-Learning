Hashtable (legacy, synchronized):
---------------------------------
- A Hashtable in Java is part of the java.util package and implements the Map interface. 
- It is one of the oldest implementations of a key-value pair storage in Java and provides synchronized operations, 
  making it thread-safe for concurrent access. 
- However, due to synchronization overhead, it is less efficient than alternatives like HashMap in single-threaded 
  environments.
